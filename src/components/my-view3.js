        <p>This is a slightly more advanced Redux example, that simulates a
          shopping cart: getting the products, adding/removing items to the
          cart, and a checkout action, that can sometimes randomly fail (to
          simulate where you would add failure handling). </p>
        <p>This view, as well as its 2 child elements, <code>&lt;shop-products&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;shop-cart&gt;</code> are connected to the Redux store.</p>
