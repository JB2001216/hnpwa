This template is still being developed  and is not yet production ready. There are things that haven't been finalized yet (such as the docs and the bundling solution), so this repo might change a signficant amount before it's ready for release.

# PWA Starter Kit

This sample app is a starting point for building PWAs. Out of the box, the template
gives you the following features:
- all the PWA goodness (manifest, service worker)
- a responsive layout
- application theming
- Redux for state management
- fast time-to-interactive and first-paint through the PRPL pattern.
- deployment to AppEngine

Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/pwa-starter-kit/wiki)
