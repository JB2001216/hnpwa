# PWA Starter Kit

This sample app is a starting point for building PWAs. Out of the box, the template
gives you the following features:
- all the PWA goodness (manifest, service worker)
- a responsive layout
- application theming
- Redux for state management
- fast time-to-interactive and first-paint through the PRPL pattern.
- deployment to AppEngine
